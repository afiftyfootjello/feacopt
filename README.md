Finite Elements Optimization in Python

Repository started for a structural optimization class at the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign. Works as far as I know.

Module division goes like:
- cofea.py: finite elements for different cases
- copt.py: some rudimentary optimizers
- numerics.py: some helpful numerical functions. Numeric integrals, derivatives, etc.
